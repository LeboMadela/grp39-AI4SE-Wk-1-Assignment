## üß† Project Overview

**ZakaBot** is a friendly, rule-based chatbot built in Python that gives investment advice based on cryptocurrency trends and sustainability. It uses basic AI logic (if-else statements and data matching) to simulate how real-world AI systems make decisions.

This chatbot was created for the PLP Academy's "AI for Software Engineering" course as part of an introductory AI assignment.

## üöÄ Features

- üìà Identifies trending or rising cryptocurrencies
- üå± Recommends the most sustainable (eco-friendly) coins
- üí∏ Suggests coins for long-term growth or profitability
- üí¨ Responds in a fun, South African tone (e.g. "Shap-Fede Boss!")
- ‚úÖ Styled responses using green text in Jupyter Notebook
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Includes investment disclaimer

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- `IPython.display` for HTML styling
- Rule-based logic (no ML libraries required)

## üîÑ Example Queries You Can Try

```
Which crypto is most sustainable?
What‚Äôs the best coin for long-term growth?
Which cryptocurrencies are trending?
Which one is profitable to invest in?
```

## üß™ How to Run ZakaBot

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**
2. Run all cells to load the chatbot logic
3. The chatbot will prompt you to type your question
4. Type any query (or "exit" to quit)

## üì∏ Demo Recording

A 42-second screen recording has been provided showcasing ZakaBot responding to sample queries, as required by the assignment.

## üìù 50-Word Summary

> ZakaBot uses rule-based logic to simulate AI decision-making. It responds to user queries by analyzing static crypto data and applying conditions to give relevant advice. While simple, it demonstrates how AI can simulate intelligent conversation without complex machine learning. It also adapts its tone for a localized user experience.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This chatbot does **not provide financial advice**. Cryptocurrency investments are risky. Always do your own research before investing.
